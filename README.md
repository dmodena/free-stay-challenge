Free Stay Challenge
===

This is a challenge to be solved with a database only, and consists of the following problem:

"Imagine there is a hotel chain, and they want to reward frequent customers. The following rules apply to the reward program:
- For every 5 nights of stay within a year, the customer gets another night for free;
- The program only credits nights based on the stays for the past 12 months;
- The credited stays can be accumulated to be used at once, or individually;
- The customer is not awarded free stays if he didn't book 5 or more nights within the past 12 months, even if he had booked more in the past"

In order to solve this I'm using PostgreSQL database and dbmate.
